# Open Ended Power BI Challenge: Building a Power BI Dashboard for Car Listings Analysis

## Business Requirements
The Australian car market is highly competitive. The management team of an automotive company seeks insights from their current inventory to optimize pricing strategies, improve inventory management, and understand market trends. As a BI analyst, my task is to analyze the dataset of car listings and build an interactive Power BI dashboard to support business decisions.

## Key Questions
The team is particularly interested in understanding:

1. What are the most popular car brands and models in their inventory?
2. How do prices vary across different car brands, fuel types, and gearbox types?
3. What is the distribution of car models by year, and how does the market age of cars impact pricing?
4. How many cars are listed as new versus used, and what is the price difference between these categories?
5. What are the trends in mileage and engine capacity across different car types?
6. How do various car attributes such as color, design type, and seating capacity impact car desirability and pricing?

This analysis will help the automotive company:
- Optimize pricing strategies based on car features and conditions.
- Manage their inventory efficiently by identifying popular or slow-moving car types.
- Understand market trends in terms of fuel type, gearbox preferences, and car age.
- Enhance customer targeting strategies based on car features and preferences.
